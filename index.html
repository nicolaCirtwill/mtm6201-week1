    <h1>Nicola Cirtwill</h1>
    <p>My name is Nicola Cirtwill, I am an aspiring illustrator and designer with a passion for relaxing with a good book, rainy days, and anything rainbow coloured. Born and raised in Ottawa Ontario, I spent most of my childhood on the St. Lawrence River and in the library reading my way through the Ottawa Public Libraries comic book collection. I am currently a first term student in the IMD program at Algonquin college returning for the spring semester. 
I like to build model sets with my boyfriend. and paint watercolour and gouache in my free time, I also enjoy making my friends and family little beaded charms and paper crafts when I have the time. Lately with the sunny May weather, I like to go out for picnics and lay down in the sunshine.
